  ## Description
  A professional README file can be created solely by using the comand-line. Simply answer the questions the inquirer asks and your README file will be dynamically created with appropriate headings, table of content, links, contact info, and screenshots. When complete, the file will be created and available in the dist folder.

  ## Installation
   Ensure you are in the root directory of your repository, then open your CLI (command-line interface) and run the command `npm install inquirer`. If you would like to add screenshots to your readme, make sure you add your own 'assets' folder with a folder named 'images' within it. There you can add your screenshot to be used in your generated file.

  ## Usage
  With node installed, from your root directory open the CLI and run the command `node index` or `node index.js`. Questions will appear for you to answer. Details are good! Once finished answering the questions, your readme will be generated and ready for you to use in the 'dist' folder.
